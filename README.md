# BEA3026 Financial Modelling Individual Assignment

**Overview**
- This is an assessed piece of work that will account for 70% of the total marks of this course.
- This is an individual assignment, and the length must not exceed 1,500 words, excluding title page, tables, figures, equations, and references.
- A word count must be placed on the front cover; 2 marks will be deducted if there is no word count, and 5 marks will be deducted if the examiner feels that there has been a deliberate attempt to give misleading information about the length of the assignment.
- Note that the results and their statistical significance will not affect the mark; instead, marks will be awarded for the way you describe each step of the modeling process and the way you report and interpret your results and conclusions. Weight will also be attached to the quality of the written presentation of your paper.
- Penalties will apply if the coursework is submitted late.

**Task Brief**
For the individual assignment, you are required to write a report on ONE of the six practical case studies undertaken during the course. The practical class chosen for the individual assignment must not be on the same topic as for the group assignment.

**Report Structure:**
Your report should be structured as answers to the following questions:

1. **What is the objective of the case study and what are the main conclusions?**
   
2. **How would a practitioner make use of the findings of the case study?**
   
3. **What are the limitations of the modeling approaches used in the case study?**
   
4. **What improvements could you make to the analysis if you had more time or better data?**


# Case Study: Momentum Strategies for G10 Currencies

## Introduction
As a quantitative analyst in the FX division of an investment bank, the objective is to design profitable strategies for the bank's traders. This case study focuses on investigating the success of momentum strategies for a portfolio of G10 currencies.

## Data Preparation

1. **Compute Monthly Returns**
   - Utilize the data file on the course website containing monthly exchange rate data for USD against G10 currencies (GBP, CAD, JPY, AUD, NZD, SEK, NOK, CHF, and EUR).
   - Compute monthly returns for each currency for a USD investor.

## Moving Average Trading Rule

2. **Construct Moving Average Trading Rule**
   - For each of the nine currencies, implement a moving average trading rule.
   - Utilize a short window length of 6 months and a long window length of 12 months.
   - Implement moving average windows using the OFFSET function for flexibility.

## Portfolio Construction

3. **Calculate Monthly Return on Portfolio**
   - Create an equally weighted portfolio of the nine currencies.
   - Calculate the monthly return on the portfolio.

## Performance Evaluation

4. **Evaluate Momentum Portfolio Performance**
   - Assess the performance of the momentum portfolio.
   - Include measures such as average return, Sharpe ratio, and maximum drawdown.

## Sensitivity Analysis

5. **Analyse Sensitivity of the Momentum Portfolio**
   - Explore the sensitivity of the momentum portfolio to changes in parameters or market conditions.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, provide insights into the profitability and performance of momentum strategies for the G10 currency portfolio. Discuss any notable findings, limitations, and potential areas for improvement.
